DuckDuckGo Custom Bang Redirects Userscript 

This userscript enhances DuckDuckGo by introducing custom bang commands that redirect searches to specific services. The script has been updated to support additional bangs, including !phind and !felo.
Features

    Enhanced Bang Commands:
        !chatgpt or !chat: Redirects to ChatGPT with the query appended by "use web search."
        !summary: Redirects to Brave Search, enabling the summary feature.
        !perp: Redirects to Perplexity.ai with the given query.
        !youai: Redirects to You.com’s AI chat with the specified query.
        !phind: Redirects to Phind.com, optimized for technical searches with multi-search enabled.
        !felo: Redirects to Felo.ai with the given query.

Installation

    Install a Userscript Manager:
        Tampermonkey for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
        Greasemonkey for Firefox.

    Add the Userscript:
        Create a new userscript in your manager.
        Copy and paste the script code into the editor.
        Save and enable the script.

Usage

In DuckDuckGo’s search bar, use the following custom bangs to redirect your search:

    !chatgpt your query
    !chat your query
    !summary your query
    !perp your query
    !youai your query
    !phind your query
    !felo your query

Replace your query with your actual search terms. The script automatically redirects to the appropriate service based on the bang.
