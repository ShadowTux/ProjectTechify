DuckDuckGo Custom Bang Redirects Userscript 

This userscript enhances DuckDuckGo by introducing custom bang commands (!chatgpt, !chat, !summary, !perp, and !youai) that redirect searches to specific services.

    !summary: Redirects to Brave Search, enabling the summary feature.
    !perp: Redirects to Perplexity.ai with the given query.
    !youai: Redirects to You.com's AI chat with the specified query.

Installation

    Install a Userscript Manager:
        Tampermonkey for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
        Greasemonkey for Firefox.

    Add the Userscript:
        Create a new userscript in your manager.
        Copy and paste the script code into the editor.
        Save and enable the script.
