ddg-bangs-redirect.js:
The **Custom AI !Bang Redirects** userscript enhances your search experience by introducing custom bang commands that redirect searches to specific AI-powered services across multiple search engines, including Google, Bing, Startpage, Brave, Ecosia, and DuckDuckGo.

**Features**

- **Enhanced Bang Commands:**
  - `!chatgpt` or `!chat`: Redirects to ChatGPT with the query appended by "use web search."
  - `!summary`: Redirects to Brave Search, enabling the summary feature.
  - `!perp`: Redirects to Perplexity.ai with the given query.
  - `!youai`: Redirects to You.comâ€™s AI chat with the specified query.
  - `!phind`: Redirects to Phind.com, optimized for technical searches with multi-search enabled.
  - `!felo`: Redirects to Felo.ai with the given query.
  - `!ecoai`: Redirects to Ecosia's AI chat with the given query.

**Installation**

1. **Install a Userscript Manager:**
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
   - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) for Firefox.

2. **Add the Userscript:**
   - Create a new userscript in your manager.
   - Copy and paste the script code into the editor.
   - Save and enable the script.

**Usage**

In the search bar of any supported search engine, use the following custom bangs to redirect your search:

- `!chatgpt your query`
- `!chat your query`
- `!summary your query`
- `!perp your query`
- `!youai your query`
- `!phind your query`
- `!felo your query`
- `!ecoai your query`

Replace `your query` with your actual search terms. The script automatically redirects to the appropriate service based on the bang.
