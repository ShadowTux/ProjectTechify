**Features**

- **Enhanced Bang Commands:**
  - `!chatgpt` or `!chat`: Redirects to ChatGPT with the query appended by "use web search."
  - `!summary`: Redirects to Brave Search, enabling the summary feature.
  - `!perp`: Redirects to Perplexity.ai with the given query.
  - `!youai`: Redirects to You.comâ€™s AI chat with the specified query.
  - `!phind`: Redirects to Phind.com, optimized for technical searches with multi-search enabled.

  - `!ecoai`: Redirects to Ecosia's AI chat with the given query.
  - `!mistral` or `!mis`: Redirects to Mistral AI's chat with the given query.

**Installation**

1. **Install a Userscript Manager:**
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
   - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) for Firefox.
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

2. **Add the Userscript:**
   - Create a new userscript in your manager.
   - Copy and paste the script code into the editor.
   - Save and enable the script.

**Usage**

In the search bar of any supported search engine, use the following custom bangs to redirect your search:

- `!chatgpt your query`
- `!chat your query`
- `!summary your query`
- `!perp your query`
- `!youai your query`
- `!phind your query`
- `!felo your query`
- `!ecoai your query`

Replace `your query` with your actual search terms. The script automatically redirects to the appropriate service based on the bang.

- The script prevents redirection loops by adding a flag to URLs
- Bangs are processed in order of length (longest first) to avoid conflicts
- Special handling is implemented for Ecosia to properly differentiate between similar bangs (like `!s` vs `!summary`)
- Qwant searches use the `q` parameter with `t=web` for proper redirects
- Mullvad Leta searches use the `q` parameter with `engine=brave` to specify the search engine
